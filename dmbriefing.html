<h2 id="a1">I. Overview of department</h2>
<h3 id="a1.1">A. Executive summary</h3>
<p>The purpose of this binder is to provide background and contextual information on Health Canada. The binder presents: an overview of Health Canada’s branches and operations, an outline of the department’s legislative and regulatory responsibilities and governance structure, an overview of federal-provincial and territorial relations, and a summary of the health portfolio’s key stakeholders. </p>
<p>Health Canada &amp; the health portfolio: A summary</p>
<p>Health Canada is the federal department responsible for helping Canadians maintain and improve their health. Health Canada promotes and helps protect the health and safety of Canadians by regulating products such as drugs, medical devices, consumer products and food. Health Canada also supports universally accessible, publicly funded health care for Canadians through stewardship of the <em>Canada Health Act</em>, leadership on emerging issues and collaboration with provinces and territories on health system improvements. This work is conducted under the purview of the Minister of Health and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and the Associate Minister of Health, alongside partners in the health portfolio.  </p>
<p>The health portfolio comprises Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. These organizations strengthen Canada’s universal health care system, manage risks to health, respond to public health emergencies, and support health research and data collection. Additionally, the health portfolio plays a significant role in priority areas such as food safety, consumer products and cosmetics, legal and illegal substances, Canada’s legal cannabis framework, and environmental health. Although the response to the COVID-19 pandemic dominated the health portfolio’s work over the past few years, the portfolio’s efforts have shifted towards key priorities that impact health of Canadians, including addressing the longstanding and systemic issues within Canada’s healthcare system, dental care, pharmacare, mental health and substance use, and ensuring an agile and modern regulatory system to protect Canadians.  </p>
<p>To strengthen Canada’s health care system, through the ‘Working Together to Improve Health Care in Canada’ plan, Health Canada is working with provinces and territories to advance four shared priorities: reducing backlogs and supporting health workers; expanding access to family health services; improving access to quality mental health and substance use services; and modernizing the health care system. Helping people in Canada age with dignity and closer to home is also a priority. Health Canada has been working collaboratively with provinces and territories, including concluding bilateral funding agreements, negotiating action plans and discussing priorities with Indigenous partners to advance these shared health priorities to improve integrated health care for Canadians. </p>
<p>An integrated, inclusive approach to investments in health service teams, the health workforce, and data and digital tools will help to meet the health and mental health needs of Canadians. Health Canada has also worked with Canadian Institute for Health Information, Indigenous partners and the provinces and territories on health data indicators to monitor progress, addressing the challenges Indigenous Peoples face in receiving fair access to healthcare services, and advancing policy work on long-term care and aging. </p>
<p>Additionally, dental care and pharmacare are key federal priorities. The Government launched the Canadian Dental Care Plan to help make oral health care more affordable for millions of Canadian residents who do not currently have access to dental insurance. The Program covers seniors aged 65 and over, Children under the age of 18 and adults with a valid disability tax credit certificate. </p>
<p>On February 29, the Minister of Health introduced Bill C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare (<em>Pharmacare Act</em>), which proposes the foundational principles for first phase of national universal pharmacare in Canada and describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and territories to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications. This legislation is an important step forward to improve health equity, affordability, and outcomes and has the potential of long-term savings to the health care system. Additionally, work is also underway to improve access to affordable and effective drugs for rare diseases aligned with the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases. </p>
<p>Over the past year, significant progress has also been made to improve access by Canadians to publicly funded mental health services, mental health equity, and a holistic approach to substance use services. This work has focused on [REDACTED] and mental health standards, timely access to  mental health services and support [REDACTED]; suicide prevention (e.g., implementing 9-8-8 suicide prevention number) and advancing a comprehensive strategy to address substance use in Canada, including the overdose crisis. The department is also advancing Budget 2024 commitments related to a new Youth Mental Health Fund to improve access to mental health care and Emergency Treatment Fund to help municipalities and Indigenous communities provide rapid responses to the opioid crisis. </p>
<p>Additionally, the department has been focused on ensuring the health of Canadians is protected by advancing a modern and agile regulatory system while also protecting the environment. This work has focused on strengthening the <em>Canadian Environmental </em><em>Protection Act</em>, including introducing mandatory labelling of chemicals, increasing testing of products, and protecting Canadians from exposure to toxic flames; ending cosmetic testing on animals; advancing comprehensive strategy to address problematic substance use, including requiring tobacco companies to pay for the cost of federal public investments in tobacco control; modernizing and strengthening the <em>Pest Control Products </em><em>Act</em>; and promoting healthy eating through the ‘Healthy Eating Strategy’, particularly focusing on restrictions on the commercial marketing of food and beverages to children. </p>
<p>The pandemic affected the capacity of Canada’s healthcare systems and exacerbated several health system challenges. As such, Health Canada has focused on addressing and expanding its work on numerous priorities, including in biomanufacturing, pandemic preparedness and research modernization. Additionally, the department continues to bolster mental health resources and address the impacts of climate change to improve human health and environmental sustainability. The federal government works with the provincial and territorial governments to advance these priorities. </p>
<h4>Federal-provincial-territorial relations </h4>
<p>Health is an area of shared responsibility among federal, provincial, and territorial governments. While the provinces and territories are responsible for delivering health care to Canadians, the federal government plays a key role in coordinating this relationship. The federal government supports universally accessible, publicly funded health care for Canadians through transfer payments to provinces and territories via the Canada Health Transfer and the administration of the <em>Canada Health Act</em>. Both orders of government collaborate on health priorities, including new healthcare funding agreements, overdose response efforts, medical assistance in dying, drug supply disruptions and shortages, and anti-antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, they share responsibility for the collection and analysis of health information, and for funding research and innovation initiatives. In Canada’s decentralized system, the pan-Canadian health organizations support shared federal and provincial/territorial interests on a pan-Canadian scale. </p>
<h4>Pan-Canadian health organizations and other key stakeholders </h4>
<p>The Government of Canada created pan-Canadian health organizations (PCHOs) to address specific healthcare system needs and issues. There are currently eight PCHOs, each of which has its own mandate and activities: Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Canadian Institute for Health Information, Healthcare Excellence Canada, Canada Health Infoway, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, Mental Health Commission of Canada, and Health Workforce Canada. The latter was created in December 2023 as a new, independent organization established by an Interim Steering Committee with support from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). The organization has been created as a stand-alone entity that will work closely with CIHI and all health care system stakeholders to improve the collection and sharing of health workforce data and share practical solutions and innovative practices. </p>
<p>Although PCHOs are operationally independent, they are accountable to the Government of Canada and are responsible for developing targeted products and services that respond to changing health needs. These organizations play a strong leadership role in collaboration with partners across the country. For example, Canada Health Infoway has been instrumental in supporting the federal priority to ensure every Canadian should be in control of their own health information through online access and benefit from it being shared securely between health professionals in the country. Health Canada in partnership with Canada Health Infoway published the shared Pan-Canadian interoperability roadmap, which represents a key milestone to advance the Government’s commitment to secure access to electronic health information. The Roadmap, endorsed by the federal, provincial and territorial governments (with the exception of Quebec), outlines a long-term vision towards improving health information exchange in Canada to improve health outcomes for everyone. The department also continues to work with CIHI on process with provinces, territories and experts to review and refine these existing common indicators and develop a broader list, including new indicators. This will enable jurisdictions and CIHI to report to Canadians based on comparable indicators and data on how health care is delivered across Canada and how it is performing and how it compares internationally. Bilateral agreements prioritize the inclusion of indicators tailored to provincial and territorial needs. </p>
<p>Health Canada works with other federal departments and agencies, non-governmental organizations, Indigenous partners, and the private sector to ensure a healthy Canadian population. This work includes partnering on research, surveillance, public consultation, policy and program development, knowledge and information sharing, and engagement with people with lived and living experiences. The health systems, research, industry, and public health stakeholders provide valuable support in addressing Canada’s health priorities. </p>
<p>Health Canada consistently provides leadership on strengthening our universal public health system. The department moves forward in applying the lessons learned from COVID-19 to address public health issues, including workforce capacity, data analytics, and health equity to ensure it is prepared for any future emergencies. In collaboration with provincial and territorial governments and a broad range of partners, Health Canada continues to deliver on commitments to improve health services for all Canadians within a world-class health system.</p>

<h4>1. Health care systems</h4>
<p>Working together plan and bilateral agreements</p>
<ul>
 <li>HPB is the portfolio lead in implementing the ‘Working Together to Improve Health Care’ for Canadians plan. </li>
 <li>On February 7, 2023, the Prime Minister announced an investment of close to $200 billion over 10 years to strengthen Canada’s universal public health care system. In addition to increases through the Canada health transfer, delivered through Finance Canada, this funding includes $25 billion over 10 years in bilateral agreement funding from Health Canada for PTs to advance four shared priorities:
   <ul>
     <li>Expanding access to family health services, including in rural and remote areas</li>
     <li>Supporting our health workforce and reducing backlogs </li>
     <li>Improving access to quality mental health, substance use, and addictions services </li>
     <li>Modernizing health systems with health data and digital tools</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Health data and digital health</p>
<ul>
 <li>A joint <a href="/en/health-canada/news/2023/10/fpt-communique-federal-provincial-territorial-health-ministers-and-ministers-responsible-for-mental-health-and-substance-use.html">FPT action plan on health data and digital health</a> endorsed by Health Ministers in October 2023, is being advanced to drive progress on the health data commitments of the Working Together to Improve Health Care for Canadians plan. Recent priorities within the plan include data stewardship, artificial intelligence in health, building public trust and literacy in health data and digital health, and better connecting Canada's healthcare system through implementation of the <a href="https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/component/edocman/resources/interoperability/6444-connecting-you-to-modern-health-care-shared-pan-canadian-interoperability-roadmap?Itemid=103">shared pan-Canadian interoperability roadmap</a>.</li>
 <li>To support advancement of the Roadmap, on June 6, 2024, the federal government introduced Bill C-72, the <a href="/en/health-canada/news/2024/06/the-government-of-canada-introduces-the-connected-care-for-canadians-act-improving-patients-safety-and-access-to-their-health-information.html">Connected Care for Canadians Act</a>. The legislation aims to improve patient safety by removing technical barriers that prevent timely and secure access to health information, by requiring the adoption of common technical and data standards and prohibiting data blocking by health IT vendors.</li>
 <li>Additionally, with an investment of $505 million over five years, the branch is working with the Canadian Institute of Health Information, Canada Health Infoway, and federal data partners to collaborate with provinces and territories in developing new health data indicators and improving use of digital tools, and to support the creation of Health Workforce Canada as a centre of excellence on health workforce data and underpin efforts to use data to improve health care. </li>
</ul>
<p>Health workforce</p>
<ul>
 <li>HPB is working to implement budget 2024 decision to provide $77.1 million over four years, starting in 2025-2026, to effectively integrate internationally educated health care professionals into Canada’s health workforce by creating 120 specific training positions, increasing assessment capacity and providing support to navigate credential recognition systems.</li>
 <li>Health Canada works closely with PT governments, as well as health system partners, to advance joint priorities related to HHR. This includes launch of the Nursing Retention Toolkit, which draws on the expertise and experience of the Canadian nursing community to support nursing retention. Further, responding to FPT Minister’s request, Health Canada has been leading an FPT study of the education and training supply and demand for healthcare professions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Aging and equity</h4>
<p><em>Safe Long Term Care Act</em></p>
<ul>
 <li>HPB is also working towards introducing a <em>Safe Long Term Care Act</em>, a component of the supply and confidence agreement with the NDP. Consultations to inform the development of the legislation took place during summer-fall 2023. This included consulting with experts, stakeholders, persons with lived experience, and provinces and territories, as well as building on existing collaborations with First Nations and Inuit partners. HPB is moving forward with developing legislation that respects provincial and territorial jurisdiction. </li>
 <li>Policy work will also focus on implementing ‘aging with dignity agreements’ with PTs, which will help Canadians age with dignity closer to home and deliver the remaining funding for home and community care ($2.4 billion remains over 4 years) and long-term care (budget 2021, $3 billion over 5 years), as well as funding for personal support workers (budget 2023, $1.7 billion over 5 years).</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-term and palliative care and medical assistance in dying</p>
<ul>
 <li>Since the launch of the 2019 action plan on palliative care, HPB has been working with stakeholders to implement projects to deliver on priorities raising awareness; providing public education on grief; improving palliative care skills and supports for health care providers, families, caregivers, and communities; enhancing data collection and research; and improving access to care for underserved populations and to culturally safe care for Indigenous communities. </li>
 <li>In line with the person-centred approach to health care, HPB is supporting provincial and territorial work to implement safe practices for medical assistance in dying for eligible Canadians who are experiencing intolerable and enduring suffering from a serious and incurable illness. This work includes leading FPT governance to help accelerate information sharing and knowledge translation of best practices; issues management around MAID implementation, including supporting the development of health system resources related to complex cases, such as those where mental illness is the sole underlying condition; and data collection, analysis and reporting. HPB is responsible for publishing an annual report on MAID assessment and provision in Canada. </li>
</ul>
<p>Part VII of the Official Languages Act</p>
<ul>
 <li>Under the modernized <em>Official Languages Act</em>, federal institutions are required to implement “positive measures” in all activities that may have an impact on official language minority communities, including grants and contributions programs, policies and bilateral agreements with provinces and territories. HPB is responsible for raising departmental awareness on these obligations in order to foster the vitality of official language minority communities, promote linguistic duality and protect the French language as well as report on results to the Treasury Board Secretariat. HPB is also responsible for delivering the official languages health program ($206,7 million over five years) to improve access to health services for official language minority communities. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thalidomide</p>
<ul>
 <li>The Canadian thalidomide survivors support program is an ex-gratia transfer payment program, established by order in council, to support Canadian thalidomide survivors (n=127 as of July 2024) for the remainder of their lives. The department has faced 17 judicial reviews in relation to the eligibility criteria (4 in process, 13 closed) and one charter claim (in process) alleging breaches of sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Organ donation and transplant</p>
<ul>
 <li>HPB is supporting pan-Canadian efforts to improve the administration and delivery of organ donation and transplantation across Canada. This includes acting as secretariat to the pan-Canadian governance framework for organ donation and transplantation, endorsed by the FPT-CDM in April 2024. In addition, through budget 2019, Health Canada is providing $ 36.5 million in funding towards the development of a pan-Canadian data and performance reporting system for organ donation and transplantation to develop integrated data solutions to facilitate the collection, utilization and sharing of standardized data and information. </li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing racism and discrimination in health system, including anti-Indigenous racism&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>Addressing racism in health care and the health care needs of specific populations such as Indigenous peoples, people living in Canada's territories, and official language minority communities continues to be a priority. Priorities include improving access to culturally safe care, establishing accountability mechanisms, building partnerships, and effecting transformative change in health systems. For example, department is providing funding to 27 organizations to improve capacity to create culturally safe and inclusive health services for Indigenous peoples. </li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Pharmaceutical policy</h4>
<p>Pharmacare</p>
<ul>
 <li>In the 2022 supply and confidence agreement, the government committed to work towards a universal national pharmacare program by passing a <em>Canada Pharmacare Act</em> and then tasking the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA) to develop a national formulary of essential medicines and bulk purchasing plan by the end of the agreement. On February 29, 2024, the government introduced bill C-64 An Act Respecting Pharmacare (<em>Pharmacare Act</em>) forming the foundation for the first phase of national universal pharmacare and the government’s intent to work with PTs to provide universal single- payer first-dollar coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications. budget 2024 reiterated the intention to engage with PTs to deliver this priority and is expected to receive royal assent in Fall 2024. In addition, an expert committee will be appointed, within 30 days of royal assent, to advise on the financing and operation of universal, single-payer pharmacare.</li>
 <li>In December 2023, Canada’s Drug Agency, built from the existing Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), was established with an investment of over $89.5 million over 5 years, starting in 2024-25. As of May 1, 2024, the new operating name of Canada’s Drug Agency was adopted, with an official launch occurring later this year.</li>
 <li>Preliminary work toward a national formulary has also been undertaken. At the request of Health Canada, Canada’s Drug Agency established a time-limited multidisciplinary advisory panel which recommended a framework and process for developing a future national formulary in June 2022. </li>
 <li>The ‘improving affordable access to prescriptions drugs agreement’ with Prince Edward Island signed in March 2022 provides $35M over four years to support the province’s efforts to provide its residents with more affordable access to prescription drugs, including expanding access to 60+ new medications to treat a variety of conditions and reducing copays to $5 for some commonly prescribed medications. Bilateral funding agreements for contraception and diabetes will be negotiated with PTs in Fall 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Patented Medicine Prices Review Board</p>
<ul>
 <li>To protect Canadians from excessive prices for patented medicines, amendments to the patented medicines regulations came into force on July 1 , 2022. This includes new basket of comparator countries and reduced reporting requirements for those medicines at lowest risk of excessive pricing. </li>
 <li>PMPRB is now developing guidelines to operationalize the regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drugs for rare diseases </p>
<ul>
 <li>In March 2023, measures were announced in support of the ‘national strategy for drugs for rare diseases’, with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three years. This funding will help provinces and territories improve access to new and emerging drugs, as well as support enhanced access to existing drugs, early diagnosis, and screening for rare diseases. In conjunction with national partners, it will also support national governance, improve collection and use of evidence to support decision-making, and advance a rare disease research agenda. Bilateral agreements on drugs for rare diseases will be negotiated in summer/fall 2024.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Health care policy priorities</h3>
<h4>1. Mental health and substance use</h4>
<ul>
 <li>In November 2021, with the appointment of an inaugural Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, the portfolio quickly mobilized its policy resources to support the new mandate. </li>
 <li>HPB, CSCB, PHAC and CIHR are assisting the minister to advance mental health and substance use priorities including:
   <ul>
     <li>Providing the minister with integrated advice from across the health portfolio on cross-cutting mental health and substance use issues</li>
     <li>Developing mental health standards with a focus on health equity</li>
     <li>Working with provinces and territories to address complex needs through integrated mental health and substance use supports</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Budget 2021 provided $45 million over two years to help develop national standards for mental health and substance use services, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders.</li>
 <li>Budget 2024 proposed $500 million over five years to support the establishment of a new youth mental health fund to: 
   <ul>
     <li>Help community health organizations provide more care for younger Canadians, and better equip these organizations to refer youth to other mental health services, and</li>
     <li>Ensure that future generations have the access they need for mental health supports so that they can have a healthy start to adulthood and can reach their full potential.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Health Canada’s controlled substance and cannabis branch is the key federal lead in addressing substance use. </li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Support federal and pan-Canadian health care policy objectives</h4>
<p>Grants and contributions programs</p>
<ul>
 <li>HPB manages a wide array of grants and contributions programs in support of health care objectives and acts as HC’s centre of expertise.</li>
 <li>The largest part of HPB’s budget is targeted transfers to PTs; federal funding is complemented by HPB work in related policy areas.
   <ul>
     <li>Bilateral agreements with PTs under the working together plan and through the aging with dignity agreements.</li>
     <li>Territorial health investment fund (territorial innovation and medical travel).</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Protecting the health of people living in Canada</h4>
<p>HECSB helps people living in Canada maintain and improve their health by focusing on diverse risks from a variety of sources. Key issues that the branch works to address include the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Air pollution could lead to disease, increased hospitalizations, and even premature death.</li>
 <li>Climate change is negatively impacting the health of people in Canada and is placing additional stress and costs on the health system.</li>
 <li>Unsafe drinking water can expose people to waterborne diseases and unsafe levels of harmful substances.</li>
 <li>Exposure to hazardous products in the workplace can be harmful to the health of employees.</li>
 <li>Unintentional events (e.g., wildfires) and intentional events (e.g., malicious use of chemicals) pose risks to people living in Canada.</li>
 <li>Canada has 19 operating nuclear reactors, ten of which are in the most populous areas of the country. Nuclear emergencies pose significant risks to human health and the environment.</li>
 <li>Exposure to chemicals found in consumer products, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food products and industrial releases can cause immediate and long-term harmful effects (e.g., cancer) to human health.</li>
 <li>Radiation exposure may cause health impacts including vision loss, tissue heating/burns, and in some cases DNA mutations that can lead to cancer. </li>
 <li>Consumer products and cosmetics may pose dangers to human health or safety (e.g., exposure to hazards including mechanical, physical, toxicological, flammability, and electrical dangers of non-compliant products). </li>

<h3 id="a1.3.5">5. Pest management regulatory agency (PMRA)</h3>
<h3>What are pesticides?</h3>
<p>Pesticides are generally toxic chemicals intentionally released into the environment to kill target pests, including in agriculture, forestry, homes and workplaces, and industrial processes. There are 680 active ingredients in approximately 7,900 registered pesticide products in Canada.</p>
<h3>Pesticides play an important tole but also present risks</h3>
<p>Canada's agriculture and agri-food system employs 2.3M people &amp; generates $150B (~6.8%) of Canada’s GDP. Canada exported ~$99.1B in agriculture products in 2023.</p>
<p>Without pesticides, corn crop yields would drop by 50% ($56B impact) in Canada and the USA.</p>
<p>What are pesticides?</p>
<ul>
 <li>Products used to control pests are commonly referred to as pesticides.</li>
 <li>They are either natural or chemically synthesized.</li>
 <li>Approximately 7,900 pesticide products registered for use in a broad range of settings including agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, industrial settings (e.g., pulp and paper) and in Canadian homes to control pests including insects, rodents and bed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we need pesticides?</p>
<p>Pesticides help manage pests, pathogens, and invasive species to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Maintain safe food productivity and support food security for the ever-growing world population.</li>
 <li>Support climate change efforts with zero-till agriculture, soil carbon sequestration and controlling invasive species.</li>
 <li>Contribute to public health by controlling disease-carrying vectors. </li>
 <li>Enable stability and growth in the agriculture/agri-food economic sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is oversight important? </p>
<ul>
 <li>Pesticides can present unacceptable risks to the environment, wildlife and human health if used inappropriately or improperly. </li>
 <li>Vulnerable populations may be disproportionately exposed to and/or negatively impacted by pesticides.</li>
 <li>The federal government regulates pesticides under the <em>Pest Control Products Act </em>(PCPA), which requires all pest control products to be registered or otherwise authorized before they can be sold or used in Canada or imported.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our mandate</h3>
<p>The Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) is the federal authority responsible for regulating pest control products in Canada, under the <em>Pest Control Products Act</em>.</p>
<p>Primary Objective - To prevent unacceptable risks to individuals and the environment from the use of pesticides.</p>

<h3>Our core activities</h3>
<p>Pre-market Product Reviews </p>
<ul>
 <li>Scientific assessments are conducted to help ensure risks to the health of Canadians and the environment are acceptable and that the product has value (e.g., will meet a need to control a pest problem)</li>
 <li>Pesticides must be registered or otherwise authorized before they can be sold or used in Canada</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-market Monitoring and Reviews</p>
<ul>
 <li>Re-evaluation - to help ensure that pesticides meet modern standards for protection of health and the environment, all pesticides must have re-evaluations initiated on a 15-year cycle.</li>
 <li>Special reviews - special reviews must be initiated if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the health and environmental risks posed by the product may no longer be acceptable.</li>
 <li>Incident reporting and sales data reporting - pesticide manufacturers are required to report an incident involving the possible use of their products, new scientific studies identifying new risks, and volumes of products sold in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transparency</p>
<ul>
 <li>Requirement to consult with the public on all proposed major registration decisions, including new registrations, major new uses of a pesticide, re-evaluations and special reviews. </li>
 <li>A wide variety of pesticide regulatory documents are made available through the public registry.</li>
 <li>The public can request to inspect the confidential test data (CTD) supporting pesticide registration decisions or proposed decisions in the case of post-market reviews (i.e., re-evaluations and special reviews).</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics</p>
<ul>
 <li>Approximate number of conventional PCPs, biopesticides, and non-conventional PCPs on the Canadian market – 8,000 registered PCPs.</li>
 <li>Each PCP is re-evaluated every 15 years, as required by the PCPA.</li>
 <li>Confidential test data requests jumped from 3 in 2021 to 25 in 2023 (increase of 833%).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our robust evidence-based decision making</h3>
<p>Because of the potential toxic nature of pest control products, the <em>Pest Control Products Act </em>requires a comprehensive (pre- and post-market) regulatory framework specific to pesticides and their uses.</p>
<p>Scientific assessments are conducted to help ensure risks to the health of Canadians and the environment are acceptable and that the product has value. These assessments consider the following:</p>

 <li>Canada is a party to the Rotterdam convention (on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade) and the Stockholm convention (on the persistent organic pollutants (POPs)).</li>
 <li>PMRA is the policy co-lead with ECCC; PMRA is the technical/scientific lead for pesticides (ECCC for industrial chemicals).</li>
</ul>
<p>Global framework on chemicals (GFC) – for a planet free of harm from chemicals and waste </p>
<ul>
 <li>The GFC provides a vision for a planet free of harm from chemicals and waste, for a safe, healthy and sustainable future – where industry and private sectors are strategic actors to foster innovation, move towards sustainable business models and drive change. </li>
 <li>Health Canada’s healthy environments and consumer safety branch, horizontal and international policy division are the federal lead, PMRA contributes on pesticide-specific issues and cross-cutting policy/strategy issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada’s 2030 nature strategy and Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (KMGBF)</p>
<ul>
 <li>On June 13, 2024, the Government of Canada released Canada’s 2030 nature strategy, which charts a path for how Canada will implement the KMGBF. This work is led by ECCC. For PMRA, relevant targets are:
   <ul>
     <li>Target 7: reducing the negative impacts of pollution on biodiversity, specifically reducing the overall risk from pesticides to biodiversity by at least 50% by 2030. PMRA is advancing real world data on pesticides, enhancing protections for human health and the environment through a continuous oversight approach to regulating pesticides, amending the PCPR to strengthen considerations on species at risk and cumulative environmental effects, and creating fee incentives to support low-risk alternatives.</li>
     <li>Target 6: reduce the impact of invasive alien species on biodiversity. PMRA is exploring reduced financial barriers for FPT and other registrants, incentivizing registration of (alternative) biopesticides and maintaining market availability of low profit highly effective IAS products.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>

 <li>The evolving global supply chain requires increased harmonization and collaboration with other regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, on good manufacturing practices inspections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Innovation </p>
<ul>
 <li>The rapid pace of innovation requires the development of new regulatory frameworks that include C&amp;E authorities (e.g., authority for inspectors to enter sites virtually and state-of-the-art laboratory equipment).</li>
</ul>
<p>Technological advancement</p>
<ul>
 <li>Innovative products require establishing new and more agile C&amp;E measures (e.g., setting terms and conditions on advanced therapies that are personalized) and state-of-the-art laboratory equipment and methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credibility as a regulator</p>
<ul>
 <li>Protection of the Canadian population requires risk-based oversight, evidence-based regulatory decision-making, transparency of inspection results, high quality scientific results, and information on health and safety risks.</li>

<p>Chief Dental Officer of Canada<br>
Dr. James Taylor</p>
<h3>Evolution of the oral health branch</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Following budget 2022, the dental care task force was created under Health Canada’s strategic policy branch, tasked with developing and implementing a national program that provides dental care coverage for low-income Canadians.
   <ul>
     <li>In December 2022, an interim Canada dental benefit (CDB) was launched, as a first step that would allow children under 12 to access dental care in the short term.</li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Budget 2023 confirmed intent to launch the Canadian dental dare plan (CDCP) and a set of complementary programming to improve the oral health of uninsured Canadians with family net incomes below $90,000.
   <ul>
     <li>An oral health access fund (OHAF) and some time-limited investments in oral health data were announced at the same time.</li>
     <li>The CDCP opened for applications in December 2023; claims processing began in May 2023.</li>
     <li>The CDCP is currently being rolled out in phases, with full implementation by 2025.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>In Fall 2023, the oral health branch was created, bringing together the dental care task force and the office of the chief dental officer of Canada (OCDOC) from the Public Health Agency of Canada.</li>
 <li>Upon its creation, the OHB was tasked with:
   <ul>
     <li>Continuing to support the CDB, until its sunset June 30, 2024;</li>
     <li>Undertaking the development and implementation of the CDCP; and</li>
     <li>Designing, developing, and implementing the OHAF to help address other barriers to accessing care that would otherwise hinder the ability of certain populations to fully benefit from the CDCP or to get access to oral health care.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a1.3.8">8. Digital transformation branch (DTB)</h3>
<h3>About us</h3>
<ul>
 <li>In December 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), created the national digital transformation office (NDTO) to support the vaccine rollout. </li>
 <li>Recognizing the heightened importance of digital capabilities and the opportunity to harness the agility of the NDTO team, the existing information management services directorate (IMSD) team within the corporate services branch (CSB) at Health Canada and the NDTO team at PHAC were consolidated to form a single unified technology, data and digital branch under Health Canada. </li>
 <li>This integration aimed to streamline our operations and enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive and agile digital solutions. Building on these foundational elements, the digital transformation branch (DTB) was formally established in April 2022 to solidify and expand upon these core functions. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How we operate</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The digital transformation branch provides enterprise IT services as a common service provider to both PHAC and Health Canada through a shared services partnership (SSP). This agreement has enabled the consolidation of several common functions, such as HR, communications, audit &amp; evaluation and IM/IT, fostering collaboration and ensuring consistent service delivery across both organizations. </li>
 <li>The digital transformation branch is led by an assistant deputy minister (ADM) and chief service and digital officer, who acts as the designated departmental chief information officer (CIO), the designated official for cyber security (DOCS) and the designated official for service, all of which are formal accountabilities with associated responsibilities delegated under the Treasury Board Secretariat policy suite for <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/topic-sujet-eng.aspx?ta=27">service and digital</a>.</li>
 <li>The digital transformation branch partners with service providers such as Shared Services Canada (SSC), Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) and Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) to deliver a wide range of services. </li>

<h3>Enabling functions: international health grants program &amp; protocol, travel and logistics service</h3>
<h4>The international health grants program (IHGP)</h4>
<ul>
 <li>The IHGP is the main mechanism used by Health Canada and PHAC to advance domestic health priorities on the international stage. Its program objectives aim to increase knowledge of current and emerging global health issues, increase collaboration and strengthen relationships with key partners, strengthen Canada’s leadership on global health issues, and enhance global health capacity/participation in priority areas. </li>
 <li>The program has $1M in available A-base funds. However, program areas use the terms and conditions (Ts&amp;Cs) to advance priority areas. Historically, the IHGP funds approximately 10-15 projects per year (of which 4-6 are A-base). </li>
 <li>The Ts&amp;Cs are ‘owned’ by PHAC. HC does not currently have a grant mechanism to fund international organizations.</li>
 <li>[REDACTED]</li>

<h3 id="a2.2">B. Legislative and regulatory responsibilities</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In Canada, health is an area of shared jurisdiction. Under the <em>Constitution Act</em>, 1867, provincial responsibilities include the establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, local matters, and property and civil rights. Over time, courts have interpreted these constitutional provisions to mean that provinces and territories (PTs) are primarily responsible for health care delivery, the administration of provincial health insurance plans, and the regulation of health professions.</p>
<p>Federal authorities in health are grounded in the federal government’s constitutional responsibilities for criminal law and taxation, and the federal spending power. These responsibilities provide the basis for helping to protect the health and safety of Canadians through the regulation of drugs, food, medical devices, controlled substances, cannabis, tobacco and vaping products, consumer products and cosmetics, pest control products, and medical assistance in dying. </p>
<p>Parliament also has the authority to spend money raised through taxation, and to attach terms and conditions to the authorized spending. Accordingly, the <em>Canada Health Act</em> establishes the criteria and conditions PT health insurance plans must meet to receive their full cash entitlement under the Canada health transfer. </p>
<p>Rooted in the “peace, order and good government” provisions of the constitution, the federal government also has key functions in relation to national health emergencies, and where public health matters are issues of national concern. Since the 1970s, federal power in public health has been interpreted to also include efforts in health research and promotion, disease prevention and health information.</p>
<p>Several other federal responsibilities include health elements, not all of which fall within the purview of the health portfolio. This includes economic powers related to trade; commerce and patents, which apply to drugs; medical devices and technologies; responsibilities in foreign affairs and immigration that relate to migration health (e.g., admission of foreign nationals with international credentials, and relations with international bodies and foreign governments); and supplementary benefits and health services for certain populations (First Nations and Inuit, refugees, the military).</p>
<h4>Health portfolio legislation and regulation</h4>
<p>There is a range of legislative mechanisms that the government can use to meet its desired objectives. Legislative tools include acts (statutes), regulations, and orders in council, all of which are relevant in the health portfolio context. While acts are laws enacted by parliament, regulations also have legally binding effects. Normally, the power to make regulations is conferred by parliament to the governor in council (cabinet), a minister, or, occasionally, an agency.</p>
<p>The Minister of Health is responsible for the administration and enforcement of aspects of approximately 40 acts (and their associated regulations) that have a direct impact on the health and safety of Canadians. </p>
<p>Three of the acts are enabling statutes, for which the minister is responsible for; that is, they create and provide the basis of the activities of the three largest portfolio organizations – Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. </p>
<p>These acts set out specific responsibilities carried out by these organizations in relation to the minister’s statutory responsibilities. These include:&nbsp; the promotion of the physical, social, and mental well-being of Canadians (<em>Department of Health Act</em>); taking public health measures, identifying and reducing public health risk factors, and supporting national readiness for public health threats (<em>Public Health Agency of Canada Act</em>); and setting safety standards for food sold in Canada, as well as enforcing the food provisions of the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> (<em>Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act</em> and the <em>Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act</em>).&nbsp; In addition, the <em>Patent Act</em> provides the legislative basis for the establishment and functioning of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. As well, the <em>Canadian Institutes of Health Research Act</em> created in 2000 the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), an arm’s-length agency that is under the management responsibility of its governing council and that reports to parliament via the Minister of Health. The objective of the CIHR is to excel in the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved health for Canadians, more effective health services and products and a strengthened Canadian health care system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Minister also has important responsibilities in relation to the administration of the <em>Canada Health Act</em> (CHA), Canada’s federal legislation on insured health services. The CHA defines the national principles that govern the Canadian health care system and aims to “… protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.” It establishes the criteria and conditions provincial and territorial health insurance plans must meet to receive their full cash entitlements under the Canada health transfer. </p>
<p>The <em>Public Health Agency of Canada Act</em> mandates the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Chief Public Health Officer to assist the Minister of Health "in exercising or performing the minister's powers, duties and functions of public health", which includes public health emergency preparedness and response. Under the <em>Emergency Management Act</em>, the Minister of Health has specific responsibilities to identify risks pertinent to his or her mandate and develop plans to address these risks. The Chief Public Health Officer also has explicit responsibilities in the emergency legislation. Emergency plans have been developed by the health portfolio that address a variety of public health risks (for example, pandemic influenza and foodborne illness).</p>
<p>To prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases in Canada, the <em>Quarantine Act</em> gives the Minister (and other designated officials) the power to take comprehensive public health measures. Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, those powers were relied upon to support the COVID-19 response, for instance by designating quarantine facilities. The <em>Quarantine Act</em> also provides the governor in council the authority to issue emergency orders prohibiting or imposing conditions on travelers entering Canada.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Under the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> and the <em>Pest Control Products Act</em>, the minister also has the authority to issue interim orders (IO) if immediate action is required to deal with a significant risk, direct or indirect, to health, safety, or the environment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, IOs were used to expedite access to important COVID-19 drugs, vaccines, disinfectants, and medical devices.</p>
<p>To help respond to COVID-19 related restrictions, which impacted access to prescription medications containing controlled substances, an exemption to certain restrictions under the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em> was issued (e.g. permitting pharmacists to extend, renew and transfer prescriptions and allowing practitioners to verbally prescribe such medications). </p>
<p>The cannabis regulations were also amended to extend the validity of medical documents whereby health care practitioners authorize their patients to access cannabis for medical purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling statutes, there are several statutes that assign the Minister of Health as the minister responsible for that statute. There are assigned statutes that establish federal frameworks (e.g., palliative care, lyme disease, post-traumatic stress disorder) or national strategies (e.g., dementia), which confer specific responsibilities on the Minister of Health.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The balance of the assigned statutes relevant to the health portfolio set out responsibilities to be carried out by the Minister of Health in the context of regulating food, pharmaceutical drugs, controlled substances, tobacco and vaping products, pest control products, medical devices, biologics, human toxins and pathogens, radiation-emitting devices, and consumer products and cosmetics.</p>
<p>There are significant differences in the nature of these various regulatory regimes. However, some principles of decision-making are common to many of the acts for which the Minister of Health is identified as exercising a role. The following section sets out some key principles. </p>
<h3>Powers, duties and functions in legislation </h3>
<p>Most acts of parliament and associated regulations are administered by individual ministers, and this responsibility can include a variety of powers, duties, and functions. Depending on the legislation (or regulations), the responsible minister can be named in the act itself or designated by the governor in council (i.e. cabinet).</p>
<p>Typically, the various powers, duties and functions set out in an act or regulations are assigned to the responsible minister. However, in some circumstances, specific authorities are assigned to other identified individuals or groups of individuals. For example, powers to make regulations and amend schedules to an act are often assigned to the governor in council. In all cases, the Minister of Health would still be involved in setting overall policy direction for regulatory programs, developing regulations, and approving regulations recommended to the governor in council.</p>
<p>The <em>Department of Health Act</em> provides that the minister “has the management and direction of the department” and must “coordinate the activities of, and establish strategic priorities for, any board or agency for which the minister is responsible and may, subject to any terms and conditions that the minister considers appropriate, delegate those powers, duties and functions to the Deputy Minister of Health”.</p>
<h4>A. Powers, duties and functions of the Deputy Minister of Health</h4>
<p>The Deputy Minister of Health is appointed by the governor in council on the Prime Minister’s recommendation and holds office during pleasure, pursuant to s. 3 of the <em>Department of Health Act</em>. The deputy minister acts generally under the direction of the minister, who maintains responsibility for the overall management and control of the department of health. The powers, duties and functions of the deputy minister are derived from four main sources of law:</p>
<p>1. The general and implicit power to act on behalf of the minister&nbsp; </p>
<p>The deputy minister is empowered to act on behalf of the minister as section 24 of the <em>Interpretation Act</em> provides that words in legislation directing or empowering a minister of the crown to do an act or thing applying to that minister as the holder of the office, include the deputy minister and persons appointed to serve in the department with appropriate capacity. This authority recognizes that a minister is not required to exercise all of statutory powers personally but is assisted by departmental officials for that purpose.</p>
<p>2. Powers delegated by the minister to the deputy head through legislation</p>
<p>Many powers and responsibilities are delegated to the deputy minister by the minister through specific provisions in various pieces of legislation. For instance, section 34 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> requires that the minister authorize the person or positions who are responsible for the payment, certification and verification of financial expenditures in the department. Other legislation such as the <em>Privacy Act</em> (section 71) or the <em>Access to Information Act</em> (section 73) provides that the minister may delegate its powers to the deputy head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>3. Powers directly vested in deputy heads by legislation</p>
<p>As a deputy head, the deputy minister of health has some specific powers and responsibilities stemming directly from legislation. For instance, the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> imposes on the deputy head the specific obligations for commitment control (section 32), maintaining adequate records in relation to public property (section 62) or ensuring appropriate internal audit capacity (section 16.1). A deputy head also has numerous direct powers and responsibilities in human resources management stemming from the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, the <em>Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act</em> and the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>.&nbsp; For instance, the deputy minister has the authority under subsection 12(1) of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> to financially penalize, suspend, demote or terminate any employee for disciplinary reasons and to terminate or demote employees for non-disciplinary reasons, including unsatisfactory performance. The deputy minister has direct authority under the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em> to determine qualifications for positions to be staffed (section 31), to deploy employees (section 51), to lay off (subsection 64(1)), or to terminate the employment of employees on probation (section 62).&nbsp; The deputy minister has direct authority under the <em>Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act</em> to establish a consultation committee (article 8), in consultation with the bargaining agents, under the <em>Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act</em>, the deputy minister is responsible for establishing a code of conduct applicable to the department of health, establishing internal procedures to manage disclosures made under this act, and designating a senior officer to be responsible for receiving and dealing with complaints of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Finally, the deputy head has the authority in legislation to receive notices and reports from tribunals and other investigative bodies, including the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the Commissioner of Official Languages, or the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Powers delegated to the deputy minister by others</p>
<p>The authority to appoint under the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em> belongs to the Public Service Commission, but has been delegated to the deputy minister for positions within the department of health (section 15 of the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>).&nbsp; Order in council (P.C. 1991/1695) provides that Treasury Board may authorize deputy heads to make ex gratia payments. As such, the deputy minister may do so for the department of health.</p>
<h4>Who makes regulatory decisions?</h4>
<p>Depending on the legislation, the authority to make decisions may be specifically assigned to the minister, to other individuals (such as designated inspectors), or, occasionally, to the governor in council. The following section explains how these different types of decision-making authorities work.</p>
<h4>A. The Minister of Health</h4>
<p>1. Decisions made by the minister or on the minister’s behalf</p>
<p>Decision-making authority in legislation often resides with the minister. In the health portfolio context, this authority encompasses many possible kinds of regulatory decisions, and on any given day, many of these decisions are made. Accordingly, the majority of decisions are made by governmental officials. This has four important advantages:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Given the volume of regulatory decisions required, it is not practical for a minister to personally exercise all of his or her authorities; </li>
 <li>The risk of perceived political interference in evidence-based decision-making is minimized;</li>
 <li>Many regulatory decisions are highly technical in nature and require a specialized (often scientific) expertise; and</li>
 <li>In the event a decision is challenged in a court of law (subject to judicial review), the person who makes the decision may need to give evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>At all times, where the decision-making authority in legislation resides with the minister, the responsible minister retains the authority to personally make those decisions. However, the practice of allowing officials to exercise regulatory decision-making powers that are appropriate to their functions is common to all regulatory departments and agencies.</p>
<p>Regulatory decisions can be scrutinized by industry, the media, the public, and the judiciary. Therefore, it is essential that the minister – or appropriately-placed officials in the health portfolio who make those decisions on behalf of the minister – are able to demonstrate integrity in their decision-making processes. It is important to demonstrate that each decision is the result of an objective – and, as applicable, science-based – assessment of all the information available to the regulator. </p>
<p>While routine and uncontroversial regulatory decisions are made every day by officials, if a decision is particularly sensitive in nature, additional background information may be provided so that the minister is aware of the context and basis for a decision.</p>
<p>2. Ministerial decision-making authority where a delegation order is required</p>
<p>In some specific instances, legislation may include specific provisions that allow the minister, as head of the institution, to make an order delegating particular powers, duties and functions to officers or employees of the institution (or to another institution within the portfolio). Relevant examples in the context of the health portfolio include the Access to<em> Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p>
<p>Some examples of the decision-making authorities assigned to the Minister of Health include the power to: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Issue a “notice of compliance” permitting the sale of a new drug in Canada (food and drug regulations);</li>
 <li>Order the recall of a drug or medical device if the minister believes it presents a serious or imminent risk of injury to health (<em>Food and Drugs Act</em>);</li>
 <li>Issue a registration permitting the sale and use of a pest control product in Canada (<em>Pest Control Products Act</em>);</li>
 <li>Issue authorizations for access to controlled substances (<em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>); </li>
 <li>Order a stop sale or stop the import of a non-compliant hazardous product (<em>Hazardous Products Act</em>);</li>
 <li>Order a recall of a consumer product that is a danger to human health or safety (<em>Canada Consumer Product Safety Act</em>);</li>
 <li>Order the recall of a food, animal or plant product that poses a health risk (<em>Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act</em>); and</li>
 <li>Establish a quarantine station and designate a quarantine facility at any place in Canada (<em>Quarantine Act</em>).</li>
 <li>Issue an interim order under the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> or the <em>Pest Control Products Act</em> if it is believed that immediate action is required to deal with a significant risk, direct or indirect, to health, safety, or the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. Other officials</h4>
<p>Many acts confer decision-making powers explicitly on individuals other than the minister.&nbsp; For example, inspection powers (such as entry, examination of records, detention of substances, etc.) can only be exercised by a designated “inspector” in the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em>, the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, and the <em>Human Pathogens and Toxins Act</em>, to name but a few. Under the <em>Quarantine Act</em>, a “quarantine officer” decides whether to require health assessments of individuals suspected of carrying a communicable disease. The Chief Public Health Officer is responsible for making certain decisions under the emergency orders issued under the <em>Quarantine Act</em>, including granting exemptions for essential workers and taking immediate public health measures to minimize the risk of introduction or spread of COVID-19 by imposing conditions on exempt persons.</p>
<p>In these instances, the minister may request a briefing in relation to the decision-making process and discuss the decision with officials, but may not make, nor is directly involved in, the decision itself. </p>
<h4>C. Independent Tribunals</h4>
<p>Some statutes create tribunals that operate independently of a minister. One such example in the health portfolio is the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB). The PMPRB is an independent, quasi-judicial body established under the <em>Patent Act</em>. The board determines whether the patented drug price set by the manufacturer is excessive and, if so, the board can order price reductions and/or the offset of excess revenues. Further, the board has the authority to issue non-binding guidelines regarding the administration of the board. However, before issuing any such guidelines, the board is required to consult with the Minister of Health, as well as other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Although the PMPRB carries out its mandate at arms-length from the Minister of Health and is independent of Health Canada, the <em>Patent Act</em> sets out several roles for the Minister of Health in relation to the PMPRB. This includes recommending new/amending regulations to the governor in council in relation to the PMPRB regime, and entering into agreements with any province to disburse funds collected by the PMPRB. </p>
<h4>D. Governor in council (cabinet)</h4>
<p>Legislation can expressly provide that the governor in council will exercise the decision-making power. An example of this is in the health portfolio is the emergency orders that can be made by the governor in council under the <em>Quarantine Act</em>, which prohibit or impose conditions on persons entering Canada. This can be done, for example, if they are coming from a country that has an outbreak of a communicable disease that could pose a threat to Canadians and no reasonable alternatives to prevent the introduction or spread of the disease are available.&nbsp; Since February 2020, the governor in council has exercised this authority to create prohibitions on entry into Canada and to impose mandatory isolation and quarantine on travelers to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Another example is under the <em>Pest Control Products Act</em>, where the governor in council may make an order cancelling or amending the registration of a pest control product if considered necessary to implement an international agreement. Neither the minister nor departmental officials may make these types of decisions on cabinet’s behalf.</p>

<h3 id="a2.4.2">Executive committee terms of reference</h3>
<h4>Authority</h4>
<p>The executive committee (EC) functions under the authorities of the deputy minister (DM) and the associate deputy minister (AsDM) to set the strategic direction of the department, make key policy and management decisions, and coordinate cross-departmental activities.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Role and mandate</h4>
<p>EC is Health Canada’s senior decision-making, direction setting and oversight body and convenes at two weekly meetings: executive committee and executive committee look ahead. </p>
<p>At EC meetings, members generally focus on policies, legislation and regulations, as well as emerging issues and trends that have departmental, portfolio or government implications.&nbsp; Members also ensure appropriate management oversight and accountability on progress, activities and performance of the department in financial management, program and service delivery, and human resources management.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>At EC look ahead meetings, members generally focus on short-term departmental business planning such as upcoming cabinet business, parliamentary activities, treasury board submissions, communications, as well as ongoing business and issues requiring senior management attention. </p>
<p>The executive committee also acts as the departmental evaluation and performance measurement committee. In this role, it serves as an advisory body to the deputy head related to the departmental evaluation plan, resourcing, and final evaluation reports and may also serve as the decision-making body on other evaluation and evaluation-related activities of the department.&nbsp; (See Appendix D – roles and responsibilities of departmental evaluation committee).</p>
<h4>Guiding principles</h4>
<p>Health Canada’s governance structure is based on the following principles: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Leadership – achieving a department-wide commitment to good governance through leadership; </li>
 <li>Accountability – being answerable for decisions and having meaningful mechanisms in place to ensure the department adheres to all applicable standards;</li>
 <li>Integrity – acting impartially, ethically and in the interests of the department; </li>
 <li>Stewardship – using every opportunity to enhance the value of the public assets and institutions that have been entrusted to care; </li>
 <li>Efficiency – ensuring the best use of resources to further the aims of the department, with a commitment to evidence-based strategies for improvement; </li>
 <li>Transparency/openness/predictability – having clear roles and responsibilities and clear procedures for making decisions; </li>
 <li>Engagement – using all opportunities to create a learning organization and to foster staff engagement; and </li>
 <li>Agility – ensuring a flexible, responsive, adaptive organization. </li>
</ul>
<p>EC and its sub-committees commit to operate with due regard to:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>Public service values, as described in the values and ethics code for the public service (i.e. democratic, professional, ethical and people values) and the Health Canada Code of Conduct;&nbsp; </li>
 <li>The Treasury Board Secretariat integrated risk-management framework and the Health Canada decision-making framework; </li>
 <li>Senior management responsibility to foster a work environment that is conducive to the effective use of both official languages, as stated in the Treasury Board Secretariat policy on official languages and Health Canada’s policy on language of work; </li>
 <li>Horizontal collaboration within the department and portfolio;&nbsp; </li>
 <li>Compliance with laws and regulations; and </li>
 <li>Departmental and government priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Position with governance structure</h4>
<p>EC is supported by the following sub-committees:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>EC – finance, investment planning and transformation (EC-FIPT) </li>
 <li>EC – people management (EC-PM) </li>
 <li>Deputy ministers’ policy committee (DMPC) </li>
 <li>EC – regulatory operations (EC-RO) </li>
 <li>EC – performance measurement and results (EC-PMR) </li>
 <li>HACE – health accord executive committee </li>
</ul>
<p>These sub-committees may serve as pre-vehicles for items scheduled for EC meetings.&nbsp; They may also have specific matters delegated to them for review or decision by EC. These sub committees are supported by:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>DG planning&nbsp; </li>
 <li>DG investment planning </li>
 <li>DG policy committee </li>
 <li>DG science </li>
 <li>DG Compliance and Enforcement </li>
 <li>Information management advisory committee </li>
</ul>
<p>An additional sub-committee made up of assistant deputy ministers, called ADM-DAC, meets quarterly to review audits, progress reports against MRAPs and audit plans being tabled at departmental audit committee (DAC) meetings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It should be noted that the structure of EC and its sub-committees should not preclude departmental management from creating and dissolving committees based on operational need. However, EC shall remain the most senior horizontal decision-making body in Health Canada.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Agenda setting</h4>
<p>The business of EC is captured in the forward agenda of EC meetings as well as the fixed agenda of EC look ahead meetings. The forward agenda of EC meetings are populated by items:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>Proposed by the chairs of the sub-committees and approved by the DM and AsDM </li>
 <li>Proposed by branches and approved by the DM and AsDM </li>
 <li>Requested by the DM and AsDM </li>
</ul>
<p>Guidance for scheduling items at EC meetings </p>
<ul>
 <li>The scope of the issue suggests that it would benefit or requires input from multiple branches; or would require implementation by multiple branches (corporate policies, changes in internal/external service delivery, etc.). </li>
 <li>The issue directly implicates the authority or accountability of multiple ADMs, the DM, the minister, cabinet or Treasury Board (e.g. memoranda to cabinet, regulatory amendments, compliance with central agency policies, etc.).&nbsp; </li>
 <li>The issue involves or could involve significant financial materiality (e.g. financial transactions, resource allocations, capital planning, etc.). </li>
 <li>The issue has policy implications with potentially significant impact to the department or the health of Canadians. </li>
</ul>
<p>Branches are encouraged to use the same criteria in proposing items for EC consideration and are encouraged to interact with the EC Services for clarification as needed.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Proposing an agenda item to DMO for a future EC meeting</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>An item for a meeting may be either requested by the chair, proposed by a sub-committee chair or by a branch.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
 <li>When a branch wishes to propose an agenda item for a future EC meeting, or is preparing an item at the request of DMO, it should submit sufficient information to ECS for appropriate planning in the forward agenda. </li>
 <li>ECS will confirm when the item can be included in the forward agenda (subject to the chair’s approval).</li>
</ul>

 <li>The template distributed to ADMOs must be used to prepare item summaries (a copy of the template is attached as appendix C). The summary is to be provided in both official languages. </li>
 <li>The item summary is used to determine appropriate timing and purpose of the item -decision or discussion.&nbsp; It also provides information on outcomes and recommendations from EC-subcommittees, as well as any previous discussions at EC, if any.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cancellation or postponement of an item </strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>To permit appropriate agenda planning, branches should advise EC as soon as possible of any cancellation or postponement of an item.&nbsp; For any cancellation or postponement within 2 weeks of a scheduled date, a rationale will need to be provided to EC.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Preparing documents for discussion and decision at EC Meetings</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in the action request, branches are to use their judgement to determine the documents most appropriate to support their items at an EC meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Branches are expected to provide coherent, well-developed materials for EC consideration five business days in advance of the EC meeting to which they are assigned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All documents submitted to EC must:&nbsp; </p>

 <li>Have been approved by the sponsoring assistant deputy minister(s) </li>
 <li>Be submitted by the requested deadline </li>

<h3 id="a3.2">Overview of Indigenous/federal/territorial roles and relations in health</h3>
<h4>Indigenous health</h4>
<p>The provision of health services to Indigenous peoples is an area of shared responsibility between FPT governments and Indigenous partners. Provincial/territorial (PT) governments provide universally accessible and publicly insured health services to all residents, including Indigenous Peoples. Whereas Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) funds or directly provides supplemental health programs and services for registered/Status First Nations (primarily on-reserve) and recognized Inuit in addition to what is provided by PTs. ISC also administers the non-insured health benefits program, which provides eligible First Nations and Inuit clients, regardless of where they reside, a range of health benefits such as prescription drugs, vision and dental care and medical supplies and equipment and medical transportation to access health services.&nbsp; PHAC also delivers off-reserve programs, such as the aboriginal head start in urban and northern communities program. </p>
<p>Further, Indigenous governments and communities may be involved in directing, managing, and delivering a range of health programs and services, which vary by PT. Examples include the BC First Nations Health Authority and the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay in Quebec. </p>
<p>Recognizing the significant disparities in Indigenous health outcomes compared to the non-Indigenous population, federal departments are committed to working with PTs to ensure First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners are included in discussions to improve access to health services and health outcomes of Indigenous Peoples and discuss progress in these areas. </p>
<p>Health Canada ensures compliance with federal obligations through routine engagement with Indigenous partners where legislation, regulations, policy or programs might impact on their rights under Section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act</em>, within the cabinet directive on the federal approach to modern treaty implementation (2015) and the collaborative modern treaty implementation policy (2023), and under the UN Declaration Act (2021) to participate in decision-making on matters that affect them, including health (Article 18) and commits to consult and cooperate in good faith (Article 19). Additionally, the health portfolio is jointly responsible for four truth and reconciliation commission’s calls to action (19, 20, 22, and 23) and for murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) calls for justice related to health (3.1-3.7). Both of which commit to improving health equity, addressing discrimination and racism, and supporting self-determination and active involvement in developing policy, legislation, and programs. </p>
<p>As part of the governance structure, regular forums provide a platform for ongoing dialogue, feedback, and collaboration between Indigenous partners and ministerial and senior officials. These include the annual permanent bilateral mechanisms with three national Indigenous organizations (NIOs): Assembly of First Nations; Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (and the four Inuit Nunangat regions); and Métis National Council and its governing members; and the intergovernmental leaders forum between the Prime Minister, appropriate federal ministers, and leaders of modern treaty and self-governing Indigenous governments. </p>
<p>The federal government has also affirmed Joyce’s Principle aimed at guaranteeing that all Indigenous people have a right of equitable access to all social and health services, without any discrimination as well as a right to enjoy the best possible physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Under Jordan’s Principle, the federal government ensures that all First Nations children living in Canada can access products, services and supports regardless of jurisdictional responsibility. Additionally, the Inuit Nunangat policy applies to all federal departments and agencies, guiding them in the design, development, and delivery of all new or renewed federal policies, programs, services, and initiatives that apply in Inuit Nunangat.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The health portfolio is also involved in a range of activities, in collaboration with Indigenous, federal, and PT partners, to improve Indigenous health outcomes. For example, Health Canada is working closely with ISC on advancing the $2B over ten years Indigenous health equity fund that was part of the February 7, 2023 health funding announcement by the Prime Minister. The fund will support First Nation, Inuit, and Métis partners in helping to address health care gaps faced by Indigenous peoples. Health Canada also continues to support ISC on the co-development of Indigenous health legislation and addressing anti-Indigenous racism in Canada’s health systems.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>FPT roles and responsibilities in health</h4>
<p>Health is an area of shared responsibility among the federal government and PT governments. Health services delivery, the administration of provincial/territorial health insurance plans, and the regulation of health professions fall within PT jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The federal government supports universally accessible, publicly funded health care for Canadians through transfer payments to PTs via the Canada health transfer (CHT) and the administration of the <em>Canada Health Act</em> (CHA). The CHA establishes the requirements that PT health insurance plans must meet to receive their full cash contributions under the CHT. As the largest major transfer to PTs, the CHT is intended to provide long-term, predictable funding for health care.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Federal responsibilities include protecting health and safety through regulation, health security and emergency preparedness and response, health promotion and chronic disease prevention, infectious disease prevention and control, as well as support for health research and innovation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While PTs must provide all residents with universally insured health services, the federal government is also responsible for the financing and administration of a range of health benefits and services for federal populations (i.e., primary health care services for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, inmates in federal penitentiaries, and refugee claimants; and supplementary benefits for registered/status First Nations and recognized Inuit, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and veterans).  </p>
<p>Additional areas of responsibility where both federal and PT levers can support common objectives include, amongst others, all aspects of public health such as surveillance, infectious disease prevention and control, health promotion and chronic disease prevention, as well as health security and emergency preparedness (including coordinating pandemic response efforts). Federal environmental health guidelines and regulations also provide guidance for provincial/territorial implementation and stewardship efforts. Both orders of government and their respective health organizations share responsibility for the collection and analysis of health information, and for funding research and innovation initiatives.</p>
<p>The diagram below summarizes the roles and responsibilities of FPT governments, including areas of overlap:</p>

</ul>
<h4>FPT collaboration</h4>
<p>Canada’s health system has been shaped by key FPT legislative activities and policies spanning decades, and it has evolved to respond to changing population needs and fiscal capacity. Ongoing FPT collaboration is crucial, as both orders of government must work together to address a full range of health priorities. This is especially true in areas where responsibilities intersect, such as funding healthcare services, responding to public health emergencies, preventing chronic disease and the spread of infectious and communicable diseases, and health promotion, amongst others.</p>
<p>FPT governments continue to collaborate on a number of high-profile priorities, including&nbsp; expanding access to family health services, reducing backlogs and supporting health care workers, improving access to quality mental health and substance use services, modernizing health systems through the use of health data and digital tools, overseeing medical assistance in dying, managing drug supply disruptions and shortages, the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs, anti-microbial resistance (AMR), and dental care, to name a few. Many of these areas require ongoing and robust FPT engagement with other sectors (e.g., agriculture, justice, and public safety). The health portfolio also frequently acts as a focal point for other sector engagement with PTs on health-related issues (e.g., Indigenous Services Canada, and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada).</p>
<h4>FPT relations landscape</h4>
<p>The level of FPT collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic was unprecedented and helped ensure a pan-Canadian response to the pandemic. Areas of collaboration focused on procurement and distribution of personal protective equipment; vaccines; public health and clinical guidance; communications and education; testing and screening, surveillance, and national reporting; border measures; and health system capacity. Considerable federal funding, programs and procurement backed these efforts, including health-related investments through the <a href="/en/intergovernmental-affairs/services/safe-restart-agreement.html">safe restart agreement</a>, and federal surge support made available through PHAC’s single-window to assist jurisdictions with health human resources, physical assets and supplies, and vaccination and epidemiological support, among others. </p>
<p>However, by the latter half of 2022, the FPT landscape and relationship became more heavily influenced by PT demands for broader health system funding and was hampered by direction from the council of the federation (CoF) to limit engagement on any new priorities until their calls for an increase to the CHT were met. The February 7, 2023 working meeting between the Prime Minister and PT Premiers marked a significant shift as the federal government announced its plan, providing a $2B top up in 2022 as well as a guaranteed 5% growth to the CHT for 5 years, and $25B over 10 years (beginning in 2023-24) in bilateral funding to support the priorities of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Expanding access to family health services</li>
 <li>Reducing backlogs and supporting health care workers</li>
 <li>Improving access to mental health and substance use services</li>
 <li>Modernizing health systems with health data and digital tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These investments are available to PTs through two bilateral agreements:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/shared-health-priorities/working-together-bilateral-agreements.html">first set of funding agreements</a> provide access to the first three years of funding to support the four new shared health priorities, as well as three years of funding for mental health and addictions services from Budget 2017 to advance the <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/principles-shared-health-priorities.html">common statement of principles on shared health priorities</a> (CSOP), beginning with a three-year agreement, supported by action plans for the same length of time. </li>
 <li>The second set of agreements support the shared priority of helping people in Canada <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/shared-health-priorities/aging-dignity-bilateral-agreements.html">age with dignity</a> and include the remaining $2.4B funding over four years for home and community care from the 2017 Budget to advance the CSOP commitments; and the $3B funding over five years for long-term care from budget 2021.
   <ul>
     <li>Both sets of bilateral agreements were signed with all jurisdictions by the end of FY 2023-24. </li>
     <li>Negotiations are now underway with PTs to access the $1.709B available over 5 years to support wage increases for personal support workers and related professions and support other recruitment/retention measures starting in 2024-25. Access to this funding will be provided vis a vis an addendum to the aging with dignity agreement.</li>
    </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of bilateral health agreements has been an effective tool in advancing other common health objectives including:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
 <li>$150M <a href="/en/health-canada/services/opioids/responding-canada-opioid-crisis/emergency-treatment-fund.html">emergency treatment fund</a> (2018) to support PTs in responding to the opioid crisis</li>
 <li>$150M <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/bilateral-agreement-pan-canadian-virtual-care-priorities-covid-19.html">virtual care bilateral agreements to support PTs acceleration of virtual care during the pandemic</a> (2021) </li>
 <li>$1B for the <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/shared-health-priorities.html">safe long-term care Fund</a> (2021) (via amendments to the home care/mental health bilateral agreements)</li>
</ul>
<p>A similar approach is being pursued to flow funding to willing PTs in support of the <a href="/en/health-canada/news/2023/03/investments-to-support-access-to-drugs-for-rare-diseases.html">national strategy for rare diseases</a> and will also be used in support of the <a href="/en/health-canada/news/2024/05/moving-forward-on-pharmacare-for-canadians.html"><em>Pharmacare Act</em></a>, following royal assent. </p>
<p>At the same time, however, PTs are becoming concerned with the degree of perceived federal overreach. In advance of the recent CoF meeting, held July 15 – 17, 2024, in NS, Premiers <a href="https://www.canadaspremiers.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/COF_Letter_to_PM_Pre-July_Meeting_July11_2024.pdf">wrote to the PM</a> reiterating calls for the federal government to “refrain from unilateral actions” and respect PT jurisdiction in matters including health care.&nbsp; These sentiments were echoed in their subsequent <a href="https://www.canadaspremiers.ca/premiers-discuss-ways-governments-can-work-together-to-better-support-canadians/">communiqué</a> issued at the end of the meeting, where they further specified that “federal initiatives such as dental care, pharmacare, and long-term care must be developed in a way that is truly collaborative, aligns with provincial and territorial priorities, and respects jurisdiction.”</p>
<h3>IFPT engagement</h3>
<p>Building on the previous commitments made in the <a href="/en/health-canada/corporate/transparency/health-agreements/principles-shared-health-priorities.html">2017 CSOP on shared health priorities</a>, the February 7, 2023 <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2023/02/07/working-together-improve-health-care-canadians">working together plan</a> set out that PTs would “agree to continue engaging with Indigenous peoples, organizations, and governments to ensure their right to fair and equitable access to quality and culturally safe health services free from racism and discrimination anywhere in Canada.” </p>
<p>The letter from then-Ministers Duclos and Bennett to PTs on February 15, 2023 also stated that “PT governments will also be encouraged to work in partnership with Indigenous organizations within their jurisdiction to support culturally safe and appropriate care for Indigenous peoples and leverage opportunities to align projects with the $2B Indigenous health equity fund.”</p>
<p>To support these efforts, Minister Duclos and Minister Hajdu (ISC) sent a joint letter to all jurisdictions (except QC) inviting them to participate in trilateral discussions with Indigenous leaders to help facilitate discussion on ways the funding can improve Indigenous access to quality and culturally safe health services. </p>
<p>Health Canada and ISC successfully convened trilateral meetings with all PTs (except QC) and their regional Indigenous partners in 2023-24 to support the development of PTs’ initial 3-year action plans. Efforts are also underway in those jurisdictions where a commitment was made to have follow-up meetings as well as scheduling meetings with the Métis National Council (MNC) governing member in Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan who were absent from the original trilateral meetings. </p>
<p>Health Canada is also working closely with ISC to help ensure that PTs are working closely with regional Indigenous partners to advance their action plans to support new healthcare funding under the working together plan. </p>
<p>Health and inclusion were among the key issues raised by NIOs during their meeting with Premiers on June 15. The meeting involved leaders of the AFN, MNC and ITK, and participation was also extended to the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC), Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) and Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Core FPT health machinery</h4>
<p>Ongoing collaboration is maintained through well-developed formal structures including: FPT health ministers’ meetings (HMM), meetings of deputy ministers (known as the conference of FPT deputy ministers of health, or CDM), and the pan-Canadian public health network (PHN). </p>
<p>The HMM forum is the key intergovernmental table through which FPT Ministers of Health discuss and provide collective direction on priority health issues and advance collaborative FPT work. The federal Health Minister is the co-chair of the HMM, and the Deputy Minister of Health Canada acts as co-chair of the CDM. Provincial/territorial co-chairs are nominated at the provincial/territorial level, and usually rotate annually following the annual in-person HMM. A network of committees (standing and ad hoc) supports the CDM and HMM on various files (Appendix A). In 2024, NS formally assumed the co-chair role from PEI. During their co-chair tenure, PEI hosted an in-person HMM in Charlottetown on October 11-12, 2023. The next face-to-face HMM is anticipated to be held in Halifax, in early November (week of November 11, date TBC). Timing may be also influenced by anticipated PT elections in the latter part of October (BC, NB, and SK). </p>
<p>FPT Ministers responsible for Mental Health and Substance Use have also been collaborating through dedicated MHSU ministerial meetings, supported by deputies and a recently established FPT ADM committee on mental health and substance sse.&nbsp; Along with the federal Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, 8 PTs now have separate, dedicated ministers (BC, AB, SK, MB, ON, QC, NB, and NS). </p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, engagement at the CDM and HMM level was at an all-time high with weekly HMM teleconferences, and daily CDM calls during the early months, to ensure coordination and sharing of information at the most senior levels. Meeting frequency has been reduced post-pandemic, and PTs continue to express a desire to continue at a moderate meeting pace (e.g., quarterly FPT CDMs) with additional time built in for forward planning on agendas and meeting schedules. In addition to the annual fall in-person HMM, CDM meet 1-2 times per year in person. Any additional meetings for these tables as well as MHSU ministers are generally held virtually. The most recent in-person FPT CDM took place June 26-27, 2024, in Halifax.</p>
<p>Regular collaboration on public health occurs through the <a href="https://www.phn-rsp.ca/en/about/index.html">PHN structure</a> and its network of supporting committees. Through the PHN, jurisdictions work collaboratively on a broad range of issues to strengthen public health in Canada, including health promotion, chronic disease prevention, public health infrastructure, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious diseases. The PHN recently finalized its 5-year strategic plan, as they look to reset their strategic priorities and structure following the pandemic. The strategic plan sets out key priorities in public health data, emergency management, communicable and infectious diseases, and health promotion and chronic disease prevention. The PHN is also focused on foundational elements of its work, including a commitment to upholding Indigenous rights and advancing reconciliation.</p>
<p>The 17-member PHN council (comprised of ADM-level FPT government officials responsible for public health) is accountable to the CDM, which provides direction and approves public health policy priorities for Canada. The Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health (CCMOH), which includes Chief Medical Officers of Health from all jurisdictions, is also responsible for technical collaboration and public health expert and scientific advice on technical issues and falls under the PHN. The CMOH from the First Nations Health Authority in BC is a member of CCMOH, and the council is seeking to expand membership to additional Indigenous CMOHs. Health Canada’s representative on the PHN council and CCMOH is Dr. Supriya Sharma, Chief Medical Advisor.</p>
<p>The PHNC has the authority to create FPT special advisory committee (SAC) which areas time-limited emergency mechanisms to advise the CDM and provide public health leadership to support a pan-Canadian, coordinated public health approach as required. SAC members include the Chief Medical Officers of Health from all PTs, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, and Chief Medical Officers from key federal departments, along with ADMs of public health from jurisdictions. The Committee is chaired by the co-chairs of the PHN council, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, and the current PT co-chair, New Brunswick’s Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Yves Léger. The SAC on COVID-19 was activated in January 2020 and deactivated in July 2023. A SAC on MPOX was activated in July 2022 and deactivated in December 2022. A SAC continues to address the toxic drug poisoning crisis. In addition, an ad hoc committee of senior leaders, consisting of CMOHs and Chief Veterinary Officers has been convening to support readiness and response on highly pathogenic avian influenza.</p>
<h3>Additional FPT machinery</h3>
<p>The federal Minister Sport and Physical Activity, supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Sport Canada, co-chairs the FPT Ministers of Sport, Physical Activity and Recreation (SPAR) table, alongside the Minister of Heritage and a PT co-chair (currently NL). The SPAR table is comprised of three distinct, but interrelated sectors: sport, physical activity, and recreation. PHAC’s President is one of three co-chairs of the FPT conference of deputy ministers of SPAR, with responsibility for physical activity items.</p>
<p>The President of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) participates at the FPT Ministers and Deputy Ministers of Agriculture meetings on matters pertaining to food safety, plant, and animal health as well as trade and market access for the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>The FPT food safety committee, on which Health Canada and CFIA participate, provides federal and provincial/territorial government leadership and partnership in food safety.</p>
<p>Additional FPT Committees have been established on mental health and substance use, cannabis legalization and regulation, antimicrobial resistance, health data, dementia, health workforce issues, medical assistance in dying, drug shortages, and interprovincial health insurance agreements, among others.</p>
<h3>Health research and innovation</h3>
<p>The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) works closely with members of the National Alliance of Provincial Health Research Organizations as key partners in the Canadian health research ecosystem. </p>
<p>Canada’s strategy for patient-oriented research (SPOR) is a national coalition of stakeholders, dedicated to the integration of research into patient care, led by CIHR at the federal level, in close collaboration with PT partners. SPOR-funded health research and platforms provide a collaborative, co-led and co-funded FPT mechanism to address jurisdictional and national priorities, improving the health of Canadians and the FPT health care systems, including their cost-effectiveness. </p>
<p>To keep pace with current health care and health research realities, CIHR is leading a refresh of SPOR. From fall 2023 to spring 2024, CIHR undertook a formal engagement process with partners and the public. A “What We Heard” report will be published on the CIHR website in late Summer or early Fall 2024. Following its release, CIHR will plan to engage with FPT partners through formal FPT tables in Fall 2024. </p>
<p>CIHR is committed to working with the PTs to improve access to mental health and substance use services, for example, through integrated youth services (IYS). IYS is an approach that provides a one-stop-shop for youth ages 12-25, that brings together service providers, youth and their families, and communities to address and deliver responsive and culturally relevant services. As part of building a Canada-wide network of provincial and territorial learning health systems for IYS that allows for data-driven research and sharing of best practices across jurisdictions, CIHR is currently investing $9M over 5 years in six IYS provincial networks and the national Indigenous IYS networks to help these networks do more research; collect, process and share data; and coordinate their work.&nbsp; Along with partner funding, CIHR has also committed $21M in upcoming funding to expand this network to all PTs; over $10M to enable the Indigenous IYS network develop into a true pan-Canadian, distinctions-based, integrated network; and $18M for an IYS data platform to enable more comprehensive data sets on youth mental health and substance use. </p>
<p>Lastly, CIHR works to accelerate the self-determination of Indigenous eoples in health research by supporting research that is driven by, and grounded in, Indigenous communities and that addresses the health challenges and inequities experienced by Indigenous peoples, including racism within Canada's health care systems.</p>

<h3 id="a3.5">Pan-Canadian health organizations</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>At different points over more than thirty years, the Government of Canada created pan-Canadian health organizations (PCHOs) to address specific health care system needs and issues. There are now eight such organizations.</p>
<p>PCHOs were created to address priorities in the Canadian health care system, recognizing their potential to tackle issues in a more targeted, pan-Canadian and flexible way than the federal government - or any one PT - can do on its own or at intergovernmental tables, with diverse mandates and activities. For example, Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA)’s&nbsp; reimbursement review program assesses the cost-effectiveness of drugs; Canada Health Infoway has directly supported provinces and territories (PTs) in the implementation of their virtual care and digital health needs; the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) reports on health system performance; and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer and the Mental Health Commission of Canada have developed national strategies on pressing health issues (cancer control and mental health respectively). While most PCHOs were established exclusively through federal investment, two (CDA and CIHI) were created in partnership with provincial/territorial governments. The recently created Health Workforce Canada was created to improve the collection and sharing of health workforce data and share practical solutions and innovative practices.</p>
<p>The federal government remains the majority funder of all PCHOs accounting for about 60-100% of total individual PCHO budgets. Based on longstanding agreements, PTs provide financial support to CIHI (approximately 20% of its budget) and CDA (approximately 15% of its budget), while Infoway cost-shares with PTs on some of the projects it funds.</p>
<p>As not-for-profit corporations, each PCHO is governed by a board of directors on which the federal government generally holds one seat, some voting and some as observers (and in a few cases also designates the board chair). A senior public servant from Health Canada typically serves as the federal representative and PTs generally have public servant representation on PCHO boards. Although PCHOs are operationally independent, they are accountable to their majority funder - the Government of Canada – for federal investments and related objectives, and so they have a vested interest in developing products and services that respond to the priorities of the federal government and their primary partners, the PTs.</p>
<h4>Mandate and core activities</h4>
<p><strong>The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)</strong> is the main national body charged with collecting, analyzing and reporting health data (e.g., wait times, quality of care and outcomes, health expenditures, allocation of health professionals), including collaborating with PTs, StatsCan, and data partners to develop and use comparable indicators on priority topics. CIHI data and information supports health system improvements and is used by Canadian governments, policy-makers and health system managers in making health policy decisions and in supporting effective health system management. CIHI relies heavily on PTs for collection of health data.</p>
<p><strong>Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA)</strong> provides decision-makers with evidence and advice to help provincial/territorial health ministries and federal- provincial/territorial (FPT) drug plans make informed decisions about the effectiveness and efficiency of drugs, medical devices and other health technologies. The expert committees from the reimbursement review program make non-binding recommendations to public drug plans that support formulary listing and reimbursement conditions decisions for new drugs. </p>
<p><strong>Canada Health Infoway (Infoway)</strong> works with PTs, health care providers and other partners to accelerate the development and adoption of digital health technologies, drive health innovation, and improve health outcomes. Infoway is currently focused on leading the development of a pan-Canadian interoperability roadmap for supporting the secure access and exchange of health data between digital solutions, supporting the adoption of standardized digital health solutions, supporting the adoption of standardized digital health tools with PTs, and an electronic proscribing system.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Excellence Canada</strong> is the amalgamated organization of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute and the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement. It works with patients and other partners to share proven innovations and best practices that lead to lasting improvements in patient safety and healthcare quality (over the pandemic, its ‘LTC+’ program provided seed funding and programming support to long-term care and retirement homes to strengthen their pandemic preparedness and response). Its current focus areas include: care closer to home and community with safe transitions; care of older adults with health and social needs; pandemic recovery and health system resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Health Workforce Canada</strong> is the recently established centre of excellence to improve health workforce data, planning and knowledge translation to action. Its establishment responds to the Government of Canada’s budget 2023 commitments to support improvements to health workforce data as well as federal/provincial/territorial health ministers’ commitment to take concrete actions to address health workforce challenges. As an independent, not-for-profit organization, HWC is working to convene and collaborate with health sector partners, including the Canadian Institute for Health Information, to improve the timely development, collection and sharing of health workforce data and advance the use of this data to support evidence-based workforce planning.</p>
<p><strong>The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC)</strong> provides national leadership to mobilize partners, including governments and cancer experts, to reduce the burden of cancer through coordinated, system-level change through the implementation of the Canadian strategy for cancer control (the strategy). The strategy is a framework for Canadian cancer control that reflects the views of cancer stakeholders, including all levels of government. It touches upon the full cancer control continuum from prevention, screening and early detection to treatment, standards and cancer guidelines through recovery and palliative care. </p>
<p><strong>The Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC)</strong> acts as a catalyst for improving the mental health system and changing the attitudes and behaviours of Canadians around mental health issues (for example, by reducing the stigma associated with mental health illness and treatment). Its work focuses on four priority areas: population-based initiatives, suicide prevention, the integration of mental health and substance use, and engagement with Canadians.</p>
<p><strong>The Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA)</strong> facilitates knowledge exchange and mobilizes research and expertise in the substance use field, promotes increased awareness among Canadians and health system stakeholders about substance use and addiction, convenes stakeholders across sectors (including those with lived and living experience) to reduce the harms of substance use, and promotes the use of programs shown to be effective in combating problematic substance use. CCSA is the only PCHO created by federal legislation.</p>
<h4>Ministerial role and engagement</h4>
<p>As PCHOs are operationally independent, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, and the Associate Minister of Health have no direct involvement in their day-to-day activities. The administration of contribution funding to each organization is delegated to Health Canada officials. The Minister of Health has ultimate oversight of federal investments in these organizations, including the use of federal funding to advance priorities and requests through cabinet for new funding to support emerging federal or FPT priorities.</p>
<p>Most federal board appointments are the prerogative of the deputy minister. However, the minister is charged with nominating a federal representative to the CPAC board of directors; the chair and one additional federal representative to the MHCC board of directors; and recommends governor in council appointments for the chair and up to four other representatives to the CCSA board of directors. Given the close relationship between the department and the organizations, the minister can also expect PCHOs to seek direct engagement from time to time on matters of relevance to their respective organizations.</p>
<h4>Role in the health system</h4>
<p>PCHOs play an important role in the health system. In Canada’s decentralized system, they can be helpful in advancing federal interests in areas of provincial/territorial responsibility, on a pan-Canadian scale. PTs are often more receptive to PCHO engagement than to direct federal government intervention. This is attributable in part to the shared governance model adopted by most PCHOs.</p>
<p>In 2018, an external review of the role of the PCHOs was conducted and produced a series of recommendations, including structural changes. In it, Drs. PG Forest and Danielle Martin made clear that while these organizations have made significant contributions over the years, the suite of PCHOs needs to be reconfigured and/or re-mandated to meet the needs of Canada's health systems in the future. Since the issuance of the report, the COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the need for organizations to be focused and responsive to federal and PT needs and objectives.</p>
<p>The amalgamation of CFHI and CPSI was a key structural change in 2021. Health Canada continues to reinforce opportunities for CCSA and MHCC to collaborate on initiatives that support an integrated/systems approach to MHSU&amp;A policy and practice. The mental health and substance use impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been profound, amplifying the significant and expanding needs of people with mental health or substance use concerns, and the close interrelationship between these two areas.</p>
<p>In addition, Health Canada has been undertaking several recommended process improvements aimed at ensuring the PCHOs, individually and collectively, contribute in a more impactful manner to federal and provincial/territorial priorities for health system improvement. For example, Health Canada worked to clarify and improve the efficiency of funding administration and PCHOs are working together to drive progress on cultural safety and Indigenous reconciliation. </p>
<p>To better support Canadian health systems in their response to the pandemic, a PCHO chief executive officer table has also met biweekly to provide a coordinated response to urgent priorities with guidance from Health Canada. In addition, Health Canada has been working closely with PTs to ensure that individual PCHOs have the guidance and direction needed to better support work on specific priorities, such as Canada Health Infoway’s work during COVID-19 to support PTs on virtual care.</p>
<h3 id="a3.6">Other key players and stakeholders</h3>
<p>The health portfolio works with a variety of key players in health, including provinces and territories, Indigenous partners, federally funded arm’s-length health organizations, non-governmental organizations, professional associations, charities, international organizations, industry, the research community, other federal departments and agencies, foreign regulators and people living in Canada. This work includes partnering on research, surveillance, public consultation, collaborative policy and program development, sharing information to support health system improvement, best practice/knowledge sharing and engagement with people with lived and living experience.</p>

<h3 id="a4.1">Minister of Health mandate letter</h3>
<p>December 16, 2021</p>
<p>Dear Minister Duclos: </p>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to serve Canadians as Minister of Health. </p>
<p>From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward. </p>
<p>During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone. </p>
<p>The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing. </p>
<p>This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights. </p>
<p>We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages. </p>
<p>Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making. </p>
<p>Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe. </p>
<p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. </p>
<p>The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.

Prime Minister of Canada</p>
<h3 id="a4.2">Minister of Mental Health and Addictions mandate letter</h3>
<p>December 16, 2021</p>
<p>Dear Minister Bennett: </p>
<p>Thank you for agreeing to serve Canadians as Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health. </p>
<p>From the beginning of this pandemic, Canadians have faced a once-in-a-century challenge. And through it all, from coast to coast to coast, people have met the moment. When it mattered most, Canadians adapted, helped one another, and stayed true to our values of compassion, courage and determination. That is what has defined our path through this pandemic so far. And that is what will pave our way forward. </p>
<p>During a difficult time, Canadians made a democratic choice. They entrusted us to finish the fight against COVID-19 and support the recovery of a strong middle class. At the same time, they also gave us clear direction: to take bold, concrete action to build a healthier, more resilient future. That is what Canadians have asked us to do and it is exactly what our Government is ready to deliver. We will work to build that brighter future through continued collaboration, engagement, and the use of science and evidence-based decision-making. With an unwavering focus on delivering results, we will work constructively with Parliamentarians and maintain our strong partnerships with provincial, territorial and municipal governments and Indigenous partners. This decade has had an incredibly difficult start, but this is the moment to rebuild a more resilient, inclusive and stronger country for everyone. </p>
<p>The science is clear. Canadians have been clear. We must not only continue taking real climate action, we must also move faster and go further. As Canadians are increasingly experiencing across the country, climate change is an existential threat. Building a cleaner, greener future will require a sustained and collaborative effort from all of us. As Minister, I expect you to seek opportunities within your portfolio to support our whole-of-government effort to reduce emissions, create clean jobs and address the climate-related challenges communities are already facing. </p>
<p>This year, Canadians were horrified by the discovery of unmarked graves and burial sites near former residential schools. These discoveries underscore that we must move faster on the path of reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples. We know that reconciliation cannot come without truth and our Government will continue to invest in that truth. As Ministers, each of us has a duty to further this work, both collectively and as individuals. Consequently, I am directing every Minister to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to work in partnership with Indigenous Peoples to advance their rights. </p>
<p>We must continue to address the profound systemic inequities and disparities that remain present in the core fabric of our society, including our core institutions. To this effect, it is essential that Canadians in every region of the country see themselves reflected in our Government’s priorities and our work. As Minister, I expect you to include and collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out and incorporate in your work, the diverse views of Canadians. This includes women, Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized Canadians, newcomers, faith-based communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2 Canadians, and, in both official languages. </p>
<p>Across our work, we remain committed to ensuring that public policies are informed and developed through an intersectional lens, including applying frameworks such as Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and the quality of life indicators in decision-making. </p>
<p>Canadians continue to rely on journalists and journalism for accurate and timely news. I expect you to maintain professional and respectful relationships with journalists to ensure that Canadians are well informed and have the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe. </p>
<p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, Canadians and their governments have adapted to new realities. Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. </p>
<p>The success of this Parliament will require Parliamentarians, both in the House of Commons and the Senate, to work together across all parties to get big things done for Canadians. I expect you to maintain constructive relationships with your Opposition Critics and coordinate any legislation with the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. As Minister, you are accountable to Parliament both individually, for your style of leadership and the performance of your responsibilities, and collectively, in support of our Ministry and decisions taken by cabinet. Open and Accountable Government sets out these core principles and the standards of conduct expected of you and your office. I expect you to familiarize yourself with this document, which outlines my expectations for each member of the Ministry. </p>
<p>Our platform lays out an ambitious agenda. While finishing the fight against the pandemic must remain our central focus, we must continue building a strong middle class and work toward a better future where everyone has a real and fair chance at success and no one is left behind. </p>
<p>As Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health, you will work with the Minister of Health to build a healthier future, with a particular focus on ensuring that health inequities are understood and addressed, including for Indigenous Peoples, Black Canadians and vulnerable Canadians. You will work to ensure that mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of our universal health care system, working in close collaboration with provinces and territories, and lead a whole-of-society approach to address problematic substance use in Canada.   </p>
<p>To realize these objectives, I ask that you achieve results for Canadians by delivering the following commitments. </p>
<ul>
 <li>Work with the Minister of Health, and with the support of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, to establish a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help expand the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental health services, including for prevention and treatment. </li>
 <li>In order to support the mental health of Canadians, develop and implement a comprehensive, evidence-based plan, leveraging existing and new investments, including to: 
   <ul>
     <li>Develop mental health standards, with a particular focus on health equity; </li>
     <li>Sustain improved access to virtual mental health services with Wellness Together Canada; </li>
     <li>Ensure timely access to perinatal mental health services; </li>

     <li>Introduce a new fund for student mental health that will support the hiring of new mental health care counsellors, improve wait times for services, increase access overall and enable targeted supports to Black and racialized students at post-secondary institutions across Canada. </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Support the Minister of Indigenous Services to co-develop and invest in a distinctions-based Mental Health and Wellness Strategy to meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation, including culturally appropriate wraparound services for addiction and trauma, suicide and life promotion and the building of treatment centres. </li>
 <li>Oversee the implementation of our investments in mental health interventions and supports for people disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including health care workers, front-line workers, seniors, Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians. </li>
 <li>Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as they recover from the impact of the pandemic. </li>
 <li>Advance a comprehensive strategy to address problematic substance use in Canada, supporting efforts to improve public education to reduce stigma, and supporting provinces and territories and working with Indigenous communities to provide access to a full range of evidence-based treatment and harm reduction, as well as to create standards for substance use treatment programs. </li>
 <li>Require tobacco manufacturers to pay for the cost of federal public health investments in tobacco control. </li>
 <li>Support the Minister of Public Safety to continue advancing Canada’s first-ever National Action Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries, including additional investment to support the health and well-being of first responders. </li>
 <li>Support the Minister of Veterans Affairs to ensure Canadian Armed Forces members and Veterans have access to adequate mental health resources, services and training programs tailored to their specific needs. </li>
 <li>With the support of the Minister of Rural Economic Development, explore pathways to increase the accessibility of mental health services in rural areas.  </li>
</ul>
