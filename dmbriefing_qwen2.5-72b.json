This involves pre- and post-market scientific assessments evaluating the toxicity, environmental impact, and value of the products. Health assessments focus on potential poisoning, cancer, and effects on neurological, reproductive, and endocrine systems. Environmental assessments examine acute and chronic impacts on various organisms. Value assessments consider the necessity and effectiveness of the pesticide, along with its social and economic impacts. Exposure assessments look at the presence of pesticides in food, water, and air, with special attention to vulnerable groups. Regulatory decisions are made to ensure no reasonable harm to human health, future generations, or the environment."
