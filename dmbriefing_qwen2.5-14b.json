It involves a framework where indigenous communities play an active role in designing, delivering, and evaluating healthcare services that are culturally appropriate and community-driven. The federal government contributes through policies, funding, and standard-setting to ensure comprehensive health coverage for indigenous peoples across Canada. Territorial governments provide local governance, resources, and implementation support specific to their regions, bridging the gap between national strategies and on-the-ground operations."
